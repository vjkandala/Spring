Spring - Spring is lightweight solution for building enterprise application using POJO. 
         It can be used in servlet container (e.g. Tomcat server) and doesn't require an Application server.
 
 a. Dependency Injection - 
    No Two classes shouldn't be depedent to each other.
    Need to achieve loose coupling between the classes using Spring DI.
    Instance of the service Implementation injected via setter/Constructor to target Object.(Reverse Way)
    
 b. Inversion of Control - 
    Inversion of control (IoC) is a programming technique in which object coupling is bound at run time 
    by an assembler object and is typically not known at compile time using static analysis.
    
    Example :
